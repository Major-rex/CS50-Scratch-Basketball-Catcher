This is a Scratch 3 game designed to be a wheelchair basketball player catching balls that drop from the top.

I want the player sprite to change to andie-b when it catches a ball, and gets back to normal afterwards.
I'd also like a score counter but I don't know how to add one.

Problem is that although my current code looks like it should work, it somehow doesn't and I'm really confused.
Thanks for your help.
